# S3
An object store that lets you store data as objects in buckets. An object is a file
and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for the file. Each object
has a key, which is the unique identifier for the object within the bucket.

## Durability and Availability
It means that S3 is designed to ensure that the objects you store are highly protected against data loss, 
with an annual durability of 99.999999999%. For example, if you store 10 million objects, 
youâ€™d statistically lose only one object every 10,000 years. S3 achieves this by replicating 
data across multiple geographically separated facilities.

Amazon S3 is 99.99% availability. Meaning it is designed to be accessible 99.99% of the time in a given year, 
which translates to less than one hour of potential downtime. Even during rare access interruptions,
the durability of data is not compromised.

## Storage classes
S3 offers multiple storage classes so you can optimize for cost and access needs. For example, 
Standard is best for frequently accessed data, while Glacier Deep Archive is ideal for long-term 
cold storage with infrequent access. Intelligent-Tiering is helpful when access patterns change, 
as it automatically adjusts tiers to save cost.

## Security
Security in S3 is handled through a combination of IAM policies, bucket policies, and encryption.
IAM ensures only authorized users and services can access buckets or objects. I always enable 
Block Public Access to avoid accidental exposure. For encryption, I use SSE-KMS when I need fine-grained control 
over keys and audit trails. I also make sure to enforce HTTPS for data in transit.
